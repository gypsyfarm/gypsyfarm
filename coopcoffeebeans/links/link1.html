<p> Hi Bill:<br>
I'm not 100% happy with the way I coded this but heck it works. I may
make changes but want to talk to you first. I've only put this on the
admin menu right now. Right now I have have it set for 5 links. I can
add as many as you like. To get a new link there must be two files in
the directory named "links" under the www directory. The first file
must be called linkX.html and the second file must be called
linkx.desc. The x should be replaced with a number from 1 to 5. The
html file is of course just an html web page. The second file is the
description which will be used to create the link to the page. DO NOT
MAKE THIS TOO LONG. If you put 1000 charactors, they will all display
in the menu. </p>
<b>Example:<br>
</b> link1.html Has a file called link1.desc. <br>
Inside link1.desc are the charactors: "New Feature!" <br>
This can be created with any text editor, including notepad. <br>
Talk with you tomorrow!
